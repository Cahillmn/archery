Adjustments for accessibility


I changed repeated alt text on my instructor’s page. 

I added an ID to my inputs and tied the labels to each input by using for=”id-value” on my radio buttons.

Wave said I skipped a heading level on my instructor’s page so I changed the h3’s to be h2’s.

I added the code to skip the nav bar and tab directly to the main content.
